    "\n",
    "* **Compiler languages**: C/C++, Fortran, ... \n",
    "  - Directly compiled to machine code that is executed by CPU \n",
    "  - Pros: fast, memory efficient\n",
    "  - Cons: longer development time, hard to debug\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interpreter languages**: R, MATLAB, Python, SAS IML, JavaScript, ... \n",
    "  - Interpreted by an interpreter\n",
    "  - Pros: fast prototyping, scripting (Linux shell scripts, Perl)\n",
    "  - Cons: excruciatingly slow for loops\n",
    "  - Usually equipped with *REPL* (Read-Eval-Print Loop) or *shell*  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Note : 'Compiler language' vs 'Intepreter language' is similar to 'reading a book' vs 'reading sentence by sentence' \n",
    " \n",
    "* Mixed (dynamic) languages: Java, Kotlin, Scala\n",
    "  - Compiled into *byte code* by the compiler, byte code is interpreted by the *virtual machine* (JVM). This scheme achieves architecture independence.\n",
    "  - More and more interpreter languages are adopting JIT(\"Just in time\") technology: R (version 3.4+), MATLAB (R2015b+), Python (PyPy), Julia, ...\n",
    "      + functions will be compiled before execution on the first or second use. For subsequent uses (e.g., calling the function within a loop), the speedup is significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Distinction between complier and interpreter languages is getting blurred due to improved computation capabilities of the modern hardware and advanced compiler techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Database languages: SQL, Hive (Hadoop).  \n",
    "  - Data analysis *never* happens if we do not know how to retrieve data from databases  "

    "  - Project started in 2009. First public release in 2012 \n",
    "  - Creators: Jeff Bezanson, Alan Edelman, Stefan Karpinski, Viral Shah\n",
    "  - First major release v1.0 was released on Aug 8, 2018\n",
    "  - Long-term support release: v1.0.5, Sept. 2019\n",
    "  - Current stable release: v1.6.2\n",
    "\n",
    "* Aim to solve the notorious **two language problem**: Prototype code goes into high-level languages like R/Python, production code goes into low-level language like C/C++. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Julia aims to:\n",
